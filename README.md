MGDC (Miami Game Design Club)

The goal of this project was to develop a Party Platformer using Unreal Engine 5. Additionally, it aimed to instruct members of the game design club on how to create a simple UE5 game in a brief period, ensuring the process was accessible and approachable.

External art assets were generated utilizing Krita, Adobe Illustrator, Blender, Maya, and Audacity.
